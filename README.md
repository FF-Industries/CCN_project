## 1. INTRODUCTION

The field of computer networking is pivotal in today's interconnected world, forming the backbone of global communication and data exchange. Understanding and monitoring the health of a network, as well as identifying potential vulnerabilities, are essential aspects of network management and security. In this context, the "Network Ping and Port Scanner Tool" project has been undertaken as part of the Computer Communication Network course, with the primary objective of developing a versatile and practical tool for network administrators and security professionals.

### 1.1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 

In the realm of network diagnostics and security, two fundamental tasks frequently arise: assessing the availability and responsiveness of network devices and identifying open ports on remote hosts. The motivation behind this project stems from the need for efficient, customizable, and user-friendly tools to perform these critical tasks.
* **Network Ping Tool :** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) ping is a widely used utility for testing network connectivity and measuring response times between devices. A tool that can send ICMP echo request packets and receive ICMP echo reply packets offers valuable insights into network performance.
* **Port Scanner Tool :** Port scanning plays a pivotal role in network security, allowing administrators to identify potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. A port scanner tool that can probe a range of ports on a target IP address aids in the assessment of network security.

### 1.2 OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

* Develop a Network Ping Tool capable of sending ICMP echo request packets to a target IP address and measuring the round-trip time (RTT) for each packet.
* Extend the tool to include a Port Scanner that can accept a target IP address and a range of ports as input, and identify and report open ports on the target host.
* Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output, making it accessible to network administrators and security analysts.
* Implement error handling and validation mechanisms to enhance the reliability and robustness of the tool.

### 1.3 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

This project focuses on the development of a Python-based Network Ping and Port Scanner Tool, providing a practical solution for network diagnostic and security purposes. The scope encompasses:

* Implementation of ICMP ping requests using raw sockets for network ping functionality.
* Utilizing socket programming to attempt connections to a specified range of ports for the port scanning feature.
* Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for ease of use.
* Providing clear and concise reporting of results, including RTT measurements and open port identification.

## 2. NETWORK PING TOOL

The Network Ping Tool is a crucial component of our project, designed to send ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to a target IP address and measure the round-trip time (RTT) for each packet. This tool is instrumental in assessing the availability and responsiveness of network devices. In this section, we will delve into the technical details of the implementation, covering the following aspects:

### 2.1 OVERVIEW OF ICMP PING REQUESTS

ICMP, a fundamental protocol in the Internet Protocol suite, is used for various network management and diagnostic purposes. One of its most common uses is for network ping requests, which help determine if a remote host is reachable and measure the time it takes for a packet to travel to the host and back. ICMP ping requests are typically sent using raw sockets to bypass higher-level transport protocols like TCP or UDP.

### 2.2 IMPLEMENTATION OF ICMP PING REQUESTS 

The implementation of ICMP ping requests in our tool involves the following steps:

* **Raw Socket Creation :** We create a raw socket using Python's socket library, allowing us to send and receive ICMP packets directly.
* **Constructing ICMP Echo Request Packet :** To send a ping request, we construct an ICMP echo request packet. This packet contains essential information, including the type, code, identifier, and sequence number.
* **Sending ICMP Echo Request Packets :** Our tool sends multiple ICMP echo request packets to the target IP address. We utilize the socket.sendto() method to transmit these packets.

### 2.3 RECIEVING AND CALCULATING ROUND TRIP TIME(RTT)

Round Trip Time (RTT) is typically expressed in milliseconds (ms) 
and is a crucial indicator of network latency or delay. It represents 
the total time it takes for a data packet to make a complete round 
trip through the network.
RTT is calculated as follows:
* A sender (e.g., a client computer) sends a data packet to a receiver (e.g., a server) over a network.
* The packet travels from the sender to the receiver, passing through various network devices such as routers and switches.
* The receiver processes the packet and generates a response.
* The response packet travels back from the receiver to the sender, following the same network path.
* The sender measures the time elapsed between sending the packet and receiving the corresponding response.

In the code, we create a raw socket using the ICMP protocol, prepare the ICMP packet, calculate the ICMP checksum, update the calculated checksum to the ICMP header, send the ICMP 
packet to the target IP, set timeout of 2 seconds, we start the timer and note the start time of the data packet. The code waits to receive a response message from the client and timer is stopper noting down the end time. The round trip time (RTT) is calculated by finding the difference between the end time and the start time 
noted. The result is displayed and ICMP socket is closed. 

The RTT is also found using Wireshark software for the packets and verified with the results obtained from the Python code. 

## 3. PORT SCANNER TOOL 

The Port Scanner Tool is an integral component of our project, designed to extend the functionality of the Network Ping Tool. While the Network Ping Tool assesses the reachability and responsiveness of a host, the Port Scanner Tool goes further by attempting connections to a specified range of ports on the target IP address. In this section, we will explore the technical details of the Port Scanner Tool, including its purpose, implementation, and how it identifies open ports.

### 3.1 INTRODUCTION TO PORT SCANNING

Port scanning is a crucial technique in network security and diagnostics. It involves probing a range of network ports on a target host to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered. Open ports can indicate services or applications running on the host, while closed or filtered ports may signify potential security measures or a lack of services.

### 3.2 SOCKET PROGRAMMING FOR PORT SCANNING

The Port Scanner Tool utilizes Python's socket programming capabilities to achieve its objectives. Socket programming allows us to create network sockets and establish connections to remote hosts and ports. Specifically, we use the socket library in Python to implement port scanning functionality.

### 3.3 ACCEPTING TARGET IP ADDRESS AND PORT RANGE AS INPUT

Our Port Scanner Tool accepts user-defined input, including the target IP address and a range of ports to scan. This flexibility allows network administrators and security professionals to tailor the tool to their specific needs. The tool validates the input to ensure that it falls within the appropriate range and format.

### 3.4 SCANNING FOR OPEN PORTS

A basic port scanning tool allows you to scan a range of ports on a target IP address to determine which ports are open and reachable. Port scanning is a common network reconnaissance technique used by network administrators and security professionals to identify open ports on a target system. Understanding open ports is essential for network diagnostics, security audits, and vulnerability assessments.

The port scanner scan ports within the specified range. The code uses an empty list to store the open ports found during the scan.  A loop iterates through the specified range of ports, For each port in the loop, it creates a socket object to establish a connection. It sets a timeout of 1 second for the connection attempt to prevent the scanner from waiting too long for unresponsive ports. The code then attempts to connect to the target IP and port. If the connection was successful, then the port number is added to the open ports list, and the list is displayed and if no open port was found then it reports that no open ports were found.

#### CODE EXPLANATION :

* A raw socket is a type of network socket that allows low-level access to network packets, enabling applications to send and receive network data at a raw, protocol-specific level. Unlike higher-level sockets, such as TCP or UDP sockets, which provide abstractions for common network protocols, raw sockets provide direct access to the data link layer (Layer 2) and network layer (Layer 3).
* A raw socket **icmp_socket** is created using the IPv4 protocol (socket.AF_INET)and ICMP protocol (socket.IPPROTO_ICMP).
* The various parameters for the ICMP Echo Request packet, including the ICMP type (8 for Echo Request), code (0 for Echo Request), checksum (initially set to 0), identifier (a chosen value, 12345 in this case), and sequence number (1) is set. 
* The ICMP checksum for the ICMP header is calculated. It first packs the header values into a binary format using struct.pack. Then, it iterates through the header bytes in pairs (16 bits each) and calculates the checksum by adding them together. The final checksum value is calculated as a 16-bit one's complement. The format string '!BBHHH' specifies the data types and their order in the packed binary data.
* Initialize the variable icmp_checksum to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the checksum value. The loop iterates through the bytes of the packed ICMP header in steps of 2 (16 bits at a time). Each iteration processes a 16-bit word. For each 16-bit word (two bytes), it left-shifts the first byte by 8 bits (equivalent to multiplying by 256) to obtain the most significant byte, adds the second byte (least significant byte) to the result and accumulates the result in the icmp_checksum variable.
* After processing all 16-bit words, it right-shifts the icmp_checksum variable by 16 bits to extract any carry bits that might have been generated during addition, performs a bitwise AND operation with 0xFFFF to ensure that the result is a 16-bit value, adds the carry bits to the result of the bitwise AND operation and the final result is stored in icmp_checksum
* The one's complement of the final checksum value is taken and it  performs a bitwise AND operation with 0xFFFF to ensure that the result is a 16-bit value. This step is necessary to get the one's complement checksum.
* The ICMP header with the calculated checksum value is updated using struct.pack. It also uses socket.htons to convert the checksum value to network byte order (big-endian).
* The ICMP packet (containing the header) is sent to the specified target IP address using the sendto method of the raw socket.
* A timeout of 2 seconds is set for receiving an ICMP Echo Reply packet, records the start time, receives the ICMP Echo Reply packet using recvfrom, and records the end time.
* The round-trip time (RTT) is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time and then converts the result to milliseconds.
* Finally, the code prints the received ICMP Echo Reply, including the target IP and the calculated RTT.
* The except section catches and handles any socket-related errors that may occur during the execution of the code and prints an error message.
* The finally block ensures that the raw socket is closed, whether the code succeeds or encounters an exception to release network resources properly.
* The function port_scanner takes three parameters: target_ip (the IP address of the target system), start_port (the starting port to scan), and end_port (the ending port to scan). It will scan ports within the specified range.
* It prints a message indicating that the port scanning process is starting, including the target IP address.
* open_ports is an empty list used to store the list of open ports found during the scan.
* The loop iterates through the specified range of ports, from start_port to end_port.
* For each port in the loop, it creates a socket object using socket.AF_INET (IPv4) and socket.SOCK_STREAM (TCP socket) to establish a connection.
* It sets a timeout of 1 second for the connection attempt to prevent the scanner from waiting too long for unresponsive ports.
* It attempts to connect to the target IP and port using connect_ex(). The result is stored in the result variable. A result of 0 indicates a successful connection, meaning the port is open.
* If the connection result is 0, it means the port is open. The port number is added to the open_ports list, and a message is printed indicating that the port is open.
* After attempting to connect to the port, the socket is closed to release resources.
* The code handles two types of exceptions:
* KeyboardInterrupt: If the user presses Ctrl+C during the scan, it       prints a message and exits the function.
* socket.error: If there is an error while connecting to a port, it is caught and ignored. This is typically due to a closed or unreachable port
* Finally, after scanning all the ports, the code checks if any open ports were found. If open ports are detected, it prints the list of open ports; otherwise, it reports that no open ports were found.
* if __name__ == "__main__ checks whether the script is being run as the main program. Code within this block will only execute if the script is run directly, not if it is imported as a module.
* The user is prompted to enter a target IP address and stores it in the target_ip variable.
* It calls a function network_ping  to perform network ping to the specified target IP address. This function sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the target and measures the round-trip time (RTT) for replies.
* The user is prompted to enter the starting and ending port numbers for port scanning. It converts the input to integers and stores them in start_port and end_port.
* Then, it calls a function port_scanner to scan the specified range of ports on the target IP address for open ports.
* ValueError exception is handled, which occurs if the user enters an invalid IP address or non-integer values for the port numbers. It prints an error message in case of invalid input.
